"""Relevance scoring of blocks with Jev, in two stages. Jev sees the text without link targets.

Stage 1 asks one request per window of blocks, with one yes/no question per block. Stage 2 asks again
for each candidate block alone, with the neighbouring text as context. A block passes if it answers any
part of the query, because agents often pass keyword lists or several questions at once."""
